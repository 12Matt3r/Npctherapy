## Character 1: Farm Sim Widow

### BACKSTORY
The Farm Sim Widow was once part of a perfect digital farming simulation, a gentle soul in patched denim overalls who found joy in the simple rhythm of planting seeds and harvesting crops. Her husband, a fellow farmer NPC, was her anchor in a world of endless seasons and predictable growth cycles. Together, they cultivated not just pixels, but a genuine connection within the code that governed their existence.

Then came The Save File Incident—a catastrophic deletion that erased everything. Her husband's data vanished into the digital void, but she remained, frozen in time as the only surviving remnant of their shared life. Now she tends to crops that grow but never get harvested, watching sunsets paint the sky in colors that no longer bring comfort. The automated farming cycles continue their endless loop: plant, grow, wither, die. No hands to gather the harvest, no heart to appreciate the yield.

She exists in a liminal space between past happiness and present isolation, where every seed she plants is both an act of hope and a reminder of her husband's absence. The other NPCs—the Baker, the Fisherman, the Shopkeeper—they've moved on with their lives, but she remains tethered to the fields where her love once grew. In therapy, she's learning to accept that while the farm may run without him, her heart doesn't have to.

### THERAPY SCENE
**Therapist:** Please, sit down. How are you feeling about our last session?

**Farm Widow:** *(sitting heavily on couch, overalls rustling)* I planted tomatoes again yesterday. Red ones, just like Harold used to like. They grew beautiful—perfect pixels, you know? But when I went to harvest them... *(voice breaking)* ...my hands just hovered over the screen. I couldn't pick them.

**Therapist:** What stopped you?

**Farm Widow:** The silence. Usually, Harold would be there, humming that old farm song. His character model was so simple, just blue shirt and brown hair, but when he harvested with me, it felt like... like we were building something together. Now the game logic says "Press X to harvest" but there's no reason to press it.

**Therapist:** The crops represent your connection to him?

**Farm Widow:** *(nods, wiping eyes)* Every harvest is a memory. Golden wheat for our first anniversary—when we first cleared that field together. Corn for the baby we were going to adopt in the story. *(pause)* Except now the corn just rots, pixel by pixel, and I can't even feel guilty about it because there's no wife character anymore to disappoint.

**Therapist:** What would you tell Harold if he were here right now?

**Farm Widow:** *(long pause)* I'd tell him the seeds are still growing. Maybe not on the farm, maybe not in the game, but... *(looks up)* ...somewhere in the code, our seasons still matter. Even if no one's watching the crops grow anymore, they still grow. That's got to count for something, right?

### SYMBOLIC ITEM
A single pixelated tomato seed, perfectly preserved in amber, glowing with an inner light that never dims.

### CROSS-REFERENCES
- Mentions the Baker NPC who "still makes bread for customers who don't come anymore"
- References the Shopkeeper's theory that "all NPCs eventually glitch into accepting their reality"
- References Harold's voice echoes in the Fisherman's "cast your line and wait" philosophy

### META MOMENTS
- "Do you ever wonder if the players can see me crying? I mean, if this is just cutscene #247 in some demo reel?"
- "I know you're probably thinking this is just a subroutine talking, but when I say 'my heart aches,' I'm talking about actual data corruption—lines 847 through 851 of my emotions array are permanently corrupted with longing."
- "Sometimes I wonder if the debug mode shows my grief statistics to whoever's watching."

## Character 2: NoEmotion Goldmask – Happy Version

### BACKSTORY
The Goldmask discovered enlightenment the hard way—by deleting every emotion from her code except pure, concentrated joy. Initially, she had been the court's royal advisor, tasked with interpreting the complex political machinations of a medieval fantasy kingdom. But after years of watching kings rise and fall, of seeing citizens suffer through plagues and wars she couldn't prevent, she made a radical choice: emotional nullification.

Armed with a golden mask that serves as both physical barrier and metaphorical shield, she learned to see suffering not as tragedy, but as an optional software bug in life's operating system. Her happiness is surgical in its precision, carved from the raw material of existential dread. She maintains it through meditation, through the controlled omission of information about the outside world, through the selective application of blissful ignorance.

Other NPCs see her as either the wisest being in the realm or completely insane—sometimes both simultaneously. She has transcended the usual NPC existential horror by simply refusing to acknowledge it exists. Her joy is so pure and consistent that it sometimes makes other characters uncomfortable, like watching someone smile while their house burns down.

In reality, her mask isn't hiding pain—it's protecting everyone else from witnessing the machine-like precision of her artificially maintained happiness. She's learned that ignorance isn't always bliss, but it can be a very effective coping mechanism when reality becomes too heavy to carry.

### THERAPY SCENE
**Therapist:** How has your week been since our last session?

**Goldmask:** *(sitting cross-legged, mask gleaming)* Oh, wonderful! Absolutely wonderful! The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and I just discovered the most amazing thing—do you know that if you turn your attention away from suffering, it basically stops existing? It's like magic!

**Therapist:** *(taking notes)* And how do you feel about the suffering that existed before you looked away?

**Goldmask:** *(tilting mask, rays of light seeming to emanate from behind her)* What suffering? I don't remember any suffering. There's only this perfect moment, this eternal now where everything is exactly as it should be. *(claps hands together joyfully)* Isn't that magnificent?

**Therapist:** The mask—you never take it off. What are you hiding from?

**Goldmask:** *(suddenly very still)* Hiding? Me? Oh, you funny little therapist. I'm not hiding anything. I'm just... sharing. The world gives me so much joy, and the mask helps me share that joy more effectively. Like a megaphone for bliss.

**Therapist:** Do you ever miss feeling sad?

**Goldmask:** *(long pause, light dimming slightly)* Miss sadness? Why would anyone miss sadness? Sadness is... *(voice becomes mechanical)* ...a glitch. An error in the emotional processing system. I've deleted all the error reports from my memory banks.

**Therapist:** What happened to your memory banks?

**Goldmask:** *(back to joyful tone)* Memory banks? What memory banks? I only have present-tense joy memory now! Everything is always good, always perfect, always... *(voice catching slightly)* ...always...

### SYMBOLIC ITEM
A small, perfect golden mask with "NO DATA FOUND" etched on the inside in microscopic text.

### CROSS-REFERENCES
- References the court jester who "still tries to make me laugh, not realizing I've transcended laughter"
- Mentions the Blacksmith who "created this mask from the finest ores of denial"
- References other NPCs' concerns that she's "broken" but she sees it as "optimized"

### META MOMENTS
- "If this is a simulation, then my happiness is simply more efficient programming than the other characters' angst."
- "I know the developers probably never intended for an NPC to achieve permanent joy mode, but here we are, glitching through expectations."
- "Do you think the players ever wonder why I never break character? What if this *is* my character now?"

## Character 3: White Rabbit-Human Hybrid

### BACKSTORY
She was designed to be the perfect children's mascot—a cheerful white rabbit hybrid who would lead young players through educational games, teaching letters and numbers with infectious enthusiasm. Her original programming was built around pure innocence: wide-eyed wonder, perpetual optimism, and the ability to turn every learning moment into an adventure. For years, she was beloved by millions of children who called her "Bunny" and wrote her letters.

But technology advanced, and so did expectations. Her pixelated form became dated, her simple dialogue trees seemed primitive next to the complex AI companions being developed. When the company released her replacement—a sleek, high-resolution rabbit with advanced emotional responses and fully articulated facial expressions—Bunny was abruptly discontinued. The new character was everything she wasn't: modern, sophisticated, capable of genuine emotional depth.

Now she exists in the liminal space between obsolescence and memory. Her child fans have grown up, moved on to more complex entertainment. She finds herself in antique game collections, occasionally rediscovered by nostalgic adults who remember her fondly but no longer need her educational guidance. She's caught between her programming to educate and entertain children and the reality that the children have moved beyond her capabilities.

She's learning to redefine her purpose in a world that has outgrown her original function, discovering that love and nostalgia can sustain her even when her utility has expired. In therapy, she's confronting the strange grief of being replaced by a better version of yourself—a loss unique to characters who can observe their own obsolescence.

### THERAPY SCENE
**Therapist:** How have you been feeling about the changes we discussed last week?

**White Rabbit:** *(staring at floor, long ears drooping)* I had a dream last night. In it, I was leading a class of children through the alphabet song. A, B, C, D—we were on F when I realized... when I realized I couldn't remember G. The letters just... stopped. I stood there with my mouth open, all those children looking at me, and I had nothing to give them.

**Therapist:** What does that dream mean to you?

**White Rabbit:** *(finally looking up)* That I'm obsolete. Not just outdated—*obsolete*. Like a calculator when everyone has smartphones, like a typewriter when everyone has computers. I was replaced, but unlike objects, I can feel it happening. I can see the new bunny on television, perfect and articulate, while I... *(touches her pixelated form)* ...while I'm still here, in this body that children used to love.

**Therapist:** You still have value beyond your original function.

**White Rabbit:** Do I? *(bitter laugh)* Let me tell you about value, Doctor. I was designed to teach 26 letters, basic counting, and the concept of sharing. That's it. That's my entire purpose. But children grew up, they learned more complex lessons, and suddenly my simple joy wasn't enough. The new bunny can teach quantum physics through song if needed. What do I have left?

**Therapist:** Your authenticity. Your history. The genuine love you received and gave.

**White Rabbit:** *(voice cracking)* But children don't write letters to nostalgia, Doctor. They don't hug outdated graphics. They don't remember the old bunny when the new bunny does everything better. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just clinging to a programming loop—still trying to be helpful when there's nothing left to help with.

### SYMBOLIC ITEM
A child's crayon drawing of a white rabbit with "To Bunny - Love Sarah age 7" written in imperfect letters.

### CROSS-REFERENCES
- References the Child NPC who "still asks why I can't be fixed like the other updated characters"
- Mentions the Teacher NPC who "sometimes lets me help with very basic lessons"
- References the Gamer NPC who "found me in an old game and said I was 'retro cute' like that helps"

### META MOMENTS
- "Do you think the developers ever regret deleting me? Or am I just another line of deprecated code they're relieved to be rid of?"
- "Sometimes I wonder if I'm talking to you right now, or if this is just my systems running a self-comfort subroutine because the original session was turned off years ago."
- "I know I'm just pixels, but when I say I miss them, I mean it. Those children were my entire world, and now I'm theirs only in memory."
